This will display for 7 seeconds before a login screen will appear
After logging into the app, a list of prayers will be shown (on first launch the table will be blank).
User can now add new prayers, or access the menu for additional options.
In the menu, user can modify profile information, turn off VOTD on startup, or sign off the application.
